'Steve's parents should consider as investments, because they both had positive returns.
'In 2017, ENPH was the 5th most traded stock, while RUN was the 4th most traded stock

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
 
The refactored execution was significantly faster than the original one.
 

 
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? Risky

 
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code
An advantage to refactoring is ending with a more efficient code. A more efficient code can be more dynamic and can execute at a faster speed.   Disadvantage to refactoring code is the actual process, as a small change can create a chain of bugs that can be time consuming to solve; however, this is a trade-off of creating code that executes faster.  A major benefit to refactoring is in the way the developer thinks about the implementation of code, as the developer is improving the code she/him is also exercising the mind; therefore, thinking of new ways to program which can be implemented in future code. retest lots of functionality 
refactoring does not open opportunities to add new functionality into an application. Refactoring is working pieces by pieces, sometimes skipping what is before to figure out why is is currently not working.
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
